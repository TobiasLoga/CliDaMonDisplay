Package: CliDaMonDisplay
Title: Shiny app for calculating and displaying monthly degree days and solar radiation for German locations selected by postal code
Description: Monthly and annual climate data are provided for specific periods allocated to German postcode zone. The climate data can be used to calulate the energy demand for space heating. Temperature and solar radiation during heating days as well as degree days are provided for specific base temperatures (10°C, 12°C, and 15°C). The package "CliDaMonDisplay" is using the data package 'clidamonger' containing monthly values for more than 800 German weather stations (starting from 1995) and the calculation package 'CliDaMon' for finding the three closest weather stations to a postcode and for calculating the degree days. The packages are based on the IWU Excel Workbook 'Gradtagzahlen-Deutschland' (available at https://www.iwu.de/publikationen/fachinformationen/energiebilanzen/gradtagzahltool/).
